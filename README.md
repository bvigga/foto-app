# foto-app
In order to ru the app

1. Clone the app onto your computer
2. Ensure you have Docker client running on your computer
3. From the root of the app, type docker-compose up -d. This will run the app in detached from.
4. The above command should pull down and start two images for for the web and another for sql server database
5. The app should be running on your localhost:8080/api/foto.
6. You can check the api end-points with swagger which comes installed as part of the app and runs at localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

I didn't conclude with hooking up and securing the Api end-points. Code is all written by testing not done
I have not implemented a test project yet. To be included and updated
